<h2> 2012 Queue ICPC Challenge </h2>

<p>
ACM Queue Magazine is offering an online programming competition based
on the 2011 International Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC)
Challenge problem. Participants will get to code a player and compete
with others in the game of Coercion. Preliminary
matches during the one-month coding phase will let you know how well
your player is doing. A final double-elimination competition among all
the submitted players will decide whose player is best.
<p>

<p>
Coding and preliminary matches will run from the start of the GMT day
on <b>January 15, 2012</b> to the end of the GMT day on <b>February
12</b>.

<h2>The Game of Coercion </h2>

<p>
The Queue ICPC Challenge game, Coercion, is played in an
environment that looks something like the following figure.  A red
player and a blue player compete to coerce regions of the playing
field to their own color.  Each player directly controls
three playing pieces called pushers.  These pieces can't
directly change colors on the field, but, they can be used to push
other playing pieces called markers around the field.  If enough
markers touch a region of the field for long enough, they can coerce
it to their own color.  If a marker is trapped for long enough in a
region of a different color, it may be coerced to that region's color.
The <a href="rules.html">game rules</a> describe how to play the game,
how to score points and how to win.

<h2>Writing your Player</h2>

<p>
Your player will be implemented as a stand-alone program, in C++,
Java, C#, Python or Javascript.  You will interact with the game by
reading information about the game world from standard input and
writing your next move to standard
output. The <a href="examples.html">sample players</a> can be a quick
way for you to get started writing your player and interacting with
the game. A more detailed description of
the <a href="environment.html">execution environment</a> explains the
input and output format for your player as well as other rules for
what your player can do.
</p>

<h2>Running a Match</h2>

<p>
Once you have a player written, you can run it by starting up the game
and pointing it to your player's executable. If you have written a
player in C++, you can run it against the sample Java player using
a command like:
</p>

<pre>
java -jar coercion.jar -player cpp myPlayer -player java -cp java_example Hunter
</pre>

<p>
If your player is implemented in Java, you can run it against the 
example player using a command like:
</p>

<pre>
java -jar coercion.jar -player java -cp java_example Planter -player java MyPlayer 
</pre>

<p>
The more detailed usage instructions describe more options for
starting up the game, including how to run the 3D visualization, how
to capture a match as a trace file and how to debug your player
during execution.
</p>

<h2>Submitting your Player</h2>

<p>
During the coding phase, players can access the competition through
the queue site
at: <a href="http://queue.acm.org/icpc/">http://queue.acm.org/icpc/</a>
From this page, participants will be able to register for the
competition, login to the submission system, submit player code and
see how they are doing in preliminary matches. The latest working
submission is considered the participant's current player. The final
tournament and the nightly preliminary matches will use the most
recently submitted player code that successfully builds.
</p>

<p>
All source code and supporting files for a player must be submitted at
once. From the submission interface, select each source file that's
part of your player, and then press the "Upload Files" button to
upload the whole thing. If you forget to submit an important file, you
will need to re-submit everything to have a working player. 
</p>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

<p>
The Queue ICPC Challenge website, <a href="http://queue.acm.org/icpc/">http://queue.acm.org/icpc/</a>, will
provide regularly updated information during the coding phase of the
competition. If corrections or clarifications are needed, they will be
linked from here.
</p>

<p>
A Google
Group <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/qicpc?pli=1">http://groups.google.com/group/qicpc?pli=1</a>
has also been set up to support player discussion about the
competition.  Volunteers from ACM Queue Magazine and ICPC will monitor
this group and try to answer questions, but, often, other participants
are able to answer questions before we get a chance to.
