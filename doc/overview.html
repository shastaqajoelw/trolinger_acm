<h1>Queue ICPC Challenge</h1>

<p>
ACM Queue Magazine is offering an online programming competition
based on the 2011 International Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC)
Challenge problem. While competitors in the ICPC are normally
concerned with writing programs that give correct output on judge's
test data, this problem presents a different type of
challenge. Instead of just running against predetermined test data,
participants must develop programs that compete against those of other
programmers. Each participant's program, their player, competes in a
game-like simulation. Success is a result of developing and
implementing a robust player with a sound strategy and correctly
anticipating the strategies employed by ones opponents.

<p>
The winter 2012 Queue ICPC Challenge offers queue readers a slightly
modified version of the programming problem that ICPC competitors
faced at the 2011 world finals. Participants get one month to develop
their players. During this coding phase, participants can submit
player code and compete against preliminary versions of their
opponent's players. Nightly updates of the preliminary standings will
tell you how well you are doing, and, based on these standings, you
can challenge other players to preliminary matches. At the end of the
coding phase, a double elimination tournament will be run among the
final submissions to decide the top four places. Final standings and
all matches in the tournament will be available for viewing from the
Queue site.
