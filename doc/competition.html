  <title>2012 Queue ICPC Challenge Competition Model </title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Competition Model</h1>

<p>
The Queue ICPC Challenge will take place in two phases.  During a four-week
coding phase, participants can develop their players and challenge
others to preliminary matches to see who's doing best.
Afterward, a double-elimination tournament will decide the winners.
</p>

<h1>Participation and Rewards</h1>

<p>
The competition is open to readers of Queue Magazine. Readers are
invited to work individually or in small teams to develop the best
player they can. The winners will be recognized on the Queue webpage,
and all tournament matches will be available for viewing from the
Queue site.
</p>

<h1>Coding Phase</h1>

<p>
At 00:00 UTC on January 15, a description of the problem will be
made available on the Queue ICPC Challenge website.  Participants can download this
description along with a copy of the game and some sample code for
players.
<p>

</p>
The coding phase will run for four weeks.  Participants can develop their
players, submit preliminary versions of their code and even compete
with preliminary versions of other participant's players.  Before the end of
the coding phase, the end of UTC day February 12, participants must submit the
final version of their players.  The last (working) version submitted before this
deadline is considered a the final submission.
</p>

<h1>Preliminary Matches</h1>

<p>
A day of the coding phase runs from 00:00 UTC to 00:00 UTC the next
day.  With the exception of the last day, preliminary matches are held
after every coding day.  At the end of each day, a snapshot of the
latest version of each participant's player will be taken.  Each player will
compete in 3 matches with other, randomly selected players.
A win/loss record for these random matches will be recorded for each
player and reported publicly at
the <a href="http://queue.acm.org/icpc/">Queue ICPC Challenge
page</a>.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the three random matches, each day a participant may request
up to three additional matches with the latest preliminary version of other
players.  These matches are held at the same time as
the random matches, using the snapshot of the players as of the end of
the coding day.  Results of these requested matches are not included
in the win/loss record and are not publicly available,
but a recording of the match is made available to both the participant
requesting the match and the participant they challenged to a match.
This gives everyone the ability to challenge others with a strong
win/loss record and see how they perform against them.  However,
electing to compete against another in a preliminary match
exposes something of your own play strategy to your opponent.
</p>

<p>
Recordings of requested preliminary matches are available the next day
from the challenge submission interface.  Recordings of the randomly
selected matches are not made available.
</p>

<h1>Final Tournament</h1>

<p>
At the end of the last coding day, February 12, a final snapshot of
every participant's submission will be taken.  These are considered the
official submissions.  In the days that follow, results of this
tournament will be posted to the Queue ICPC Challenge page, typically
with a few rounds of the tournament posted each day.
