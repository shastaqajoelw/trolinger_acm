<h1>Example Players</h1>

<p>
In the distribution binary, the various example directories contain
sample players implemented in each of the available competition
languages.  The source code for these demonstrates how a player is to
interact with the game, and they may give you some ideas about how
your own player could operate.  Of course, these players are not too
smart.  Using them as a starting point, you can probably do much
better.
</p>

<p>
You can build these players independently and then run them against
each other in the game using a command like the following.  If you've
compiled the example players, and left their executables in the same
directories as the source code, you should be able to run this command
from the top-level directory of the expanded
game <a href="coercion.zip">distribution binary</a>:
</p>

<pre>
java -jar coercion.jar -player cpp c++_example/gather -player java -cp java_example Migrate
</pre>

<p>
Source code for the Java player is stored in
a <code>java_example</code> subdirectory, but its code is defined in
the default package.  The <code>-cp java_example</code> on the command
line adds <code>java_example</code> to the class path before running
this player.  If you put your Java player in the current directory,
you won't need the <code>-cp</code> option.
</p>

<h2>C++ Example Player</h2>

<p>
The C++ example player, gather, tries to collect markers in its
starting corner of the field.  If the player can keep this space from
changing color, it can use it to coerce these markers to its color.
The player then tries to push the markers to other parts of the field
to coerce the color there.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="../c++_example/Util.h">Util.h</a> : Game-specific
    constants and utility functions.
<li> <a href="../c++_example/gather.cpp">gather.cpp</a> : Main file for
the C++ player.
</ul>

<h2>Java Example Player</h2>

<p>
The Java sample player, Migrate, simply takes each of the markers that
start out in the player's color and tries to push them to the edge of
the player's territory.  If the player is able to coerce these
boundary regions to its color, it pushes the markers to a new boundary
edge and expands the territory further.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="../java_example/Migrate.java">Migrate.java</a> : Main file for the Java player.
</ul>

<h2>C# Example Player</h2>

<p>
The C# sample player, Migrate.cs, is a port of the Java sample player,
it takes each of the markers that start out in the player's color and
tries to push into new territory to convert it.
</p>

</ul>

<h2>Python Example Player</h2>

<p>
The Python example player is a port of the C++ player, gather.  It
tries to convert markers by moving them into it's home space, then it
moves them out into the field to try to claim new territory.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="../python_example/gather.py">gather.py</a> : Source file for
the Python example player.

Coming Soon.
