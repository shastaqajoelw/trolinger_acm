<h1>Player/Game Interface</h1>

<p>
Player implementations are external to the game itself.  A player is a
separate executable that communicates with the game via standard input
and standard output.  The player is executed when the game starts up
and continues running until the game is finished.  At the start of the
game, the game engine sends each player a description of the field
geometry.  At the start of each turn, the game engine sends the player
a description of the current game state.  The player reads this
description from standard input, chooses a move for each pusher and
sends it back by writing it to standard output.
</p>

<h2>One-Time Field Description</h2>

<p>
At the start of the game, each player receives a description of the
playing field.  This description is given as a list of the vertices at
the corners of the field regions and a list of the regions
themselves.
</p>

<p>
The list of field vertices starts with a line containing a single
positive integer, <var>v</var>, giving the number of vertices in the
field.  This is followed by <var>v</var> lines, each giving the
integer <var>X</var>, <var>Y</var> and <var>Z</var> coordinates of a
vertex.  The ordering of vertices is significant.  It is used in the
region list that follows.  The first vertex given is at index zero
and the last vertex is at index <var>v - 1</var>.
</p>

<p>
The list of regions starts with a line containing a single positive
integer, <var>r</var>, giving the number of regions in the field.  This
is followed by <var>r</var> lines, each describing a region.  A region
is described by a positive integer, <var>k</var>, giving the number of
corners the region has.  This is followed by <var>k</var> non-negative
integers giving indices into the vertex list.  Looking down, the
vertices of a region are given in counter-clockwise order.  The field will
have no more than 200 vertices and no more than 200 regions.
</p>

<p>
The player is guaranteed that the field is always completely covered
with convex polygon regions, and no regions overlap.  Neighboring
regions always share vertices along their boundaries.  If the boundary
of a region passes through a vertex, then the description of that
region will include that vertex.  For example, in the figure below,
region <var>r<sub>1</sub></var> will include the top vertex connecting
regions <var>r<sub>2</sub></var> and <var>r<sub>3</sub></var>.
</p>

<h2>Per-Turn Game State</h2>

<p>
At the start of each turn, the game engine sends each player updated
region colors, pusher positions and marker positions.  This
description starts with a line containing an integer, <var>t</var>,
indicating the turn number.  This value will normally start at zero
and increment to 899 as the game progresses.  If the player
fails to respond promptly enough with a move for each pusher, the
player may miss a turn.  This will be indicated to a player by a skip
in the turn number.  When the game is over, a value of -1 is sent to
the player to indicate that no more game states will follow.  At this
point, the player should exit.
</p>

<p>
The turn number is followed by a line giving the current score for
each player, first an integer giving the score for the red player and
then an integer giving the score for the blue player.  Player scores
are followed by a line giving the current color of each map region.
This line will start with an integer, <var>r</var>, the
number of regions on the map.  This value will always match the value
of <var>r</var> given at the start of the game.  This will be followed
by <var>r</var> values indicating the region colors in the same order
the region list was given at the start of the game.  Colors are
described as follows.
</p>

<a name="color.table"/>
<table border=1>
<tr> <th>Value</th> <th>Color</th> </tr>
<tr> <td>0</td> <td>red</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>1</td> <td>blue</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>2</td> <td>grey</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
The next section gives the location and state of all the pushers.
This always starts with a line containing the value 6,
the total number of pushers in the game.  This is followed by
6 lines.  Each of these lines consists of four floating
point values, the <var>X</var> location of a pusher, the <var>Y</var>
location of the pusher, the <var>X</var> component of the pusher's
velocity and the <var>Y</var> component of the pusher's velocity.  The
first three pushers described are for the current player and the next
three are for the opponent.  Pusher descriptions are always given
in the same order, and the order matches the ordering of initial
positions given in the <a href="rules.html#initial.field">initial
field</a> section of the rules.
</p>

<p>
The final section of the game state description gives the locations,
velocities and colors of all the markers.  This starts with a line
giving the number of markers, which is always 22.  The
next 22 lines describe each marker with five
parameters.  The first two are real values giving the <var>X</var>
and <var>Y</var> coordinates of the marker center.  The next two are
real values giving the <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var> components of the
marker velocity.  The last is an integer giving the marker color
according to the <a href="#color.table"/> color table</a> above.
</p>

<p>
For each player, the ordering of elements on the pusher list and the
marker list remains the same from turn to turn.  For example, if a
particular marker is at index 7 in the marker list at turn 25, it
will still be at index 7 for turn 26.  The locations and velocities of
moving objects may change from turn to turn, but the ordering of the
pusher list and marker lists will let the player keep track of
specific markers.
</p>

<h2>Player Output Format</h2>

<p>
At each turn, the player is to print a desired move to standard
output.  The move is described by six floating point parameters, the
<var>X</var> and <var>Y</var> components of an acceleration vector to
be applied to the first pusher, the <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var>
components of an acceleration vector to be applied to the second
pusher, and the <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var> components of an
acceleration vector to be applied to the third pusher. The six
parameters for each move should be printed, space-separated on a
single output line.  To ensure that the game is able to read the move
immediately after it is produced, the player should flush standard
output after the move is printed.
</p>

<p>
As described in the <a href="rules.html#pusher.section">pusher</a>
section of the rules, the game will limit each pusher acceleration
vector to a magnitude of 2 and will constrain the
pusher velocity to a magnitude of 6 after the
acceleration is applied.
</P>

<h2>Real-Time Response Requirement</h2>

<p>
After a snapshot of the game state is sent, the player generally has
one tenth of a second to respond with a move.  For the first turn of
the game, the player has a full second to respond, but subsequent
turns give the player only 0.1 seconds.  The additional time for the
first move reflects the need to give languages like Java an
opportunity to demand-load code used by the player.  This can cause
the first move to take longer than subsequent moves.
</p>

<p>
If the player fails to respond or if the response is received too
late, the game will assign an acceleration vector of zero to all the
player's pushers.
The game expects to receive a move for each state that is sent to a
player, but the game engine does not maintain a queue of game states
on behalf of each player.  If a player falls behind in parsing game
states and responding with a desired move, the engine will discard,
rather than queue, subsequent states for the player.  A player that is
too slow to respond will receive a sampling of the states, and the
value of the turn number will indicate that one or more states have
been dropped.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the game, a report is printed to standard output
indicating any game states that were discarded without being sent to
each player.  Likewise, a list is printed reporting any moves that
were not received from the player in time.
</p>

<h2>Player-Centric Encoding</h2>

<p>
Communication with the player is encoded so that both players can be
written as if they control the red player, the one that starts out in
the front left corner of the field.  Internally, the first player
specified at startup is actually the red player.  For communication
with the second player, game state is encoded with coordinates for all
geometry rotated 180 degrees about the center of the field.  Colors
are flipped so that the second player sees red game elements as blue
and blue game elements as red.  The ordering of field vertices, region
lists, pusher lists and markers is also reversed so that the the blue
player's initial view of the field is exactly like the red player's
initial view.  This is intended to simplify the design of the player
somewhat.  Developers may wish to hard-code some behaviors with field
locations or other constants chosen at compile time.
</p>

<h2>Player Debugging</h2>

<p>
Your player's standard output is used to communicate with the game
engine.  While developing your player, you will want to send any
debugging output you need to standard error rather than standard
output, so that the game engine doesn't think it's part of your move.
</p>

<p>
As described in the usage instructions, the game engine can operate
synchronously with the player, waiting indefinitely for each move
before performing the next simulation step.  This lets the developer
suspend the real-time response requirement during debugging.  The game
engine can also be configured to dump game state and player move
information for every turn in a game.  This can let the developer
inspect the sequence of messages exchanged between game and player after a
game is completed.
</p>

<h2>Frame Interpolation</h2>

<p>
Players turns occur every 0.1 seconds.  The 0.1 second delay is
intended to give the player an adequate time to select a next move.
However, displaying animation frames at this framerate yields a jumpy
visualization.  To help smooth things out, the game engine computes
additional, intermediate states for animation.  These are apparent when
visualizing a live game and they affect the contents of the trace file
when a game is recorded for later playback.  This behavior should not
be apparent to players participating in the game, but, if ignored, it
might cause some confusion about apparent inconsistency between the
player's view of the game and the contents of a saved game trace file.
</p>

<h1>Tournament Execution Environment</h1>

<p>
Once you have a working player, you will want to submit it to the
Queue ICPC
Challenge site to see how it does against real opponents.  For
preliminary matches and for the final tournament, player code will be
compiled and will run on a virtual machine running on a 3.0 Ghz Xeon
processor installed with Ubuntu 10.4 Linux.
</p>

<p>
During matches, player code will have uncontested use of a single core
and 1 GB of physical memory, except for the overhead associated with
the operating system and the virtual machine environment. During
execution, player submissions will be permitted to read from standard
input and write to standard output and standard error. They may also
open files in the current directory for reading and even create new
threads.  Attempts to access other system resources (e.g., read from
files elsewhere, create network connections, start new processes) may
result in disqualification.
</p>

<h2>Player Operation and Organization</h2>

<p>
Source code for a player may consist of multiple files, but all files
must reside in a single directory. Java implementations should place
all classes in the default package.
</p>

<p>
Submissions can include source files and data files supporting the
player, but the submission for a single player cannot exceed 256
kilobytes in total size and 50 individual files. During execution,
player's source code and any other submitted files will be available
in the current directory.
</p>

<p>
For C/C++ submissions, all files ending in .cpp will be compiled and
linked together into an executable. During compilation, the submission
directory will be the current directory. Player code will be compiled
with g++ version 4.4.3 with the -O option and will be linked with
-lpthread.  For Java submissions, all files ending in .java will be
compiled with Sun JDK 1.6.0_20. Only one main function is expected in
the resulting classes, and that class will be executed as the player.
</p>

<p>
For C# submissions, all files ending in .cs will be compiled with a
single invocation of gmcs, version 2.4.4.0. The resulting executable will be run via
mono.
</p>

<p>
For Python submissions, only on source file ending in .py is
expected. This file will be run as the player using Python 2.6.5.
</p>

<p>
Javascript players are being run using Rhino 1.7 release 2.  As with
python, there should be only one file ending in .js.  This file will
be given to rhino on the command line.  Javascript support is new for
this competition.  We welcome suggestions from Javascript programmers
about what execution environment might be preferred.
</p>

<p>
Submission language is determined by the file name extensions used in
the submission. Submissions that appear to contain a mixture of
languages (e.g. some ending in .java and some in .cpp) will be
considered invalid, as will submissions do not compile or do not have
a single entry point.
