<h1>Playing The Game</h1>

<p>
The game of Coercion is a two-player game, where a red and a blue
player each try to claim as much playing field territory as they can.
Each player controls three moving pieces called <i>pushers</i>.
Using these pushers to strategically position <i>markers</i> of
various colors around the field, players can acquire territory by
coercing it to switch to their own color.  Each player's score reflects how
much territory they have acquired, and the winner is the one with the
most at the end of the match.
</p>

<p>
A match of Coercion proceeds through a series of 900
turns.  At the start of each turn, both players are given a
description of the current state of the game.  For each turn, the
player directs how their three pushers should change movement
direction.  Based on the player's move, the game updates the movement
directions for the pushers and then simulates one turn of movement for
all pushers and markers.  At the end of the turn, the colors of
markers and field regions may change, depending on how the markers are
positioned and how long they have been in those locations.
</p>

<h1>The Playing Field</h1>

<p>
The game is played on a field of convex polygon regions.  Regions are
planar, with their vertices at various heights, and any region can
change color between red, blue and grey.  The goal of a player is to
convert regions of the largest total area to the player's color.
</p>

<img src="coords.png" alt="Game Coordinate System" align="center"
     width=400 height=401/>

<p>
The playing field uses a three-dimensional coordinate system,
with <var>X = 0</var> at the left edge and <var>X = 100</var>
at the right edge.  The <var>Y</var> values range from 0 at the front
edge to <var>100</var> at the back edge.  The
positive <var>Z</var> axis points up.  The <var>100 &times;
100</var> field is entirely covered by planar, convex polygon
regions.  The vertices at the corners of the regions always have
integer coordinates.
</p>

<p>
Most aspects of the game only depend on two-dimensional geometry
in <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var>.  Variations in <var>Z</var> give
each region a slope, and gravitational acceleration will make objects
tend to roll downhill.
</p>

<h2>Pushers</h2>

<img src="pushers.png" alt="Pusher playing piece" align="right"
     width=250 height=81/>

<p>
Each player has control of three playing pieces called <i>pushers</i>.
The pusher is modeled as a circle (in the <var>XY</var> plane) with a
radius of 1 and a mass of 1.  The pusher
maintains a current location and velocity.  The location corresponds
to the center of the circle, and velocity is expressed as distance
moved (in field units) in the <var>XY</var> direction per turn.
Pusher movement is frictionless, but it is affected by gravitational
acceleration and the slope of the region under it.  Pushers bounce
elastically off the edge of the field and off other moving objects.
</p>

<p>
A player controls its pushers by applying a two-dimensional force
vector to the pusher in the <var>XY</var> plane.  After a player's
move is received, each force vector is added to the corresponding
pusher's velocity before movement for that turn is simulated.  A force
vector can be up to 2 in magnitude.  If a force vector
of greater magnitude is given by the player, the game will reduce its
magnitude to 2 while keeping its direction the same.
After the force vector is added to the pusher's velocity, the velocity
is restricted to a magnitude of 6.  If a pusher's
speed exceeds 6 units per turn after the move is
applied, the magnitude of the velocity is reduced to
6, while its direction remains the same.
</p>

<h2>Markers</h2>

<img src="markers.png" alt="Marker playing piece" align="right"
     width=250 height=114/>

<p>
The field contains 22 <i>markers</i>.  A marker is modeled
as a circle (in the <var>XY</var> plane) with a radius of 2
and a mass of 3.  Like the pusher, each marker has a
velocity and a current location indicating the <var>XY</var> location
of the marker's center.  Markers bounce elastically off the edge of
the field and other moving objects.
</p>

<p>
Each marker has a color, either red, blue or
grey, and its color can change based on the regions it's touching.
A marker is subject to gravitational acceleration based on the slope
of the region under it, and it also experiences friction with the
surface of the field.  The speed of a marker is reduced by
0.35 at the start of each game turn.
</p>

<a name="initial.field"/>
<h2>Initial Field</h2>

<p>
The red player starts in the front left corner of the field, and the
blue player starts in the back right corner.  The geometry of the field may
vary from match to match, but it will not change during a match; only
the colors of the field regions can change.  Field geometry is also
guaranteed to be symmetric under a 180-degree <var>Z</var> rotation
about the field center.  Thus, each player is presented with matching
field geometry.
</p>

<p>
The following figure illustrates a typical starting configuration for
a match.  The geometry of most regions may vary from match to match,
including the shapes of field regions, their heights and their slopes.
For every field, however, each player always starts with a <i>home
region</i>.  The home region of the red player is always a horizontal
(no slope) <var>20 &times; 20</var> region at the front
left corner of the field.  The blue player always has a
matching <var>20 &times; 20</var> home region at the
back right corner.  Each player's home region is the same
color as the player.  All other regions are initially grey.
</p>

<img src="initial.png" alt="Initial Field Layout" align="center"
     width=480 height=395/>

<p>
The red player always starts with three pushers at locations 
<var>(5, 10), (5, 5)</var> and <var>(10, 5)</var>, and the blue
player starts with three pushers at locations <var>(90, 95), (95,
95)</var> and <var>(95, 90)</var>.  The red player's home region
starts with three red markers at locations <var>(5, 15), (10, 10
)</var> and <var>(15, 5)</var>, while the blue player's home regions
starts with three blue markers at <var>(85, 95), (90, 90)</var>
and <var>(95, 85)</var>.  Sixteen grey markers start out at the
following locations:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>(5, 75)</td>
<td>(15, 65)</td>
<td>(25, 55)</td>

<td>(85, 35)</td>
<td>(95, 25)</td>
</tr>
<table>

<p>
Speeds of
markers and pushers are initially zero, but the pushers outside the
home regions might start to slide downhill immediately, depending on
the region they are in.  Playing pieces in the home region are on a
horizontal surface, so they won't slide downhill.
</p>

<h2>Color Coercion</h2>

<p>
Players earn points for coercing field regions to their own color.
Both field regions and markers can change color during the game,
depending on how they are in contact.  We say a marker touches a
region if the region overlaps anywhere with the marker's
two-dimensional representation, a radius 2 circle in
the <var>XY</var> plane.  Enough markers touching a region
can <i>coerce</i> that region to switch to the marker's color.  If a
marker stays inside regions of a different color long enough, the
marker may be coerced to that region's color instead.
</p>

<p>
We say color <var>c</var> applies pressure to some region <var>r</var>
if <var>r</var> has a color that's different from <var>c</var> and
more markers of color <var>c</var> are touching
<var>r</var> than markers of any other color.  For example, if some
region is touched by three red markers, two grey markers and one blue
marker, then red is applying pressure to the region.  If
color <var>c</var> is applying pressure to region <var>r</var> at the
ends of 20 consecutive turns, region <var>r</var>
will be coerced to color <var>c</var> at the end of the
20<sup>th</sup> turn.
</p>

<p>
Each player's home region is special.  It starts out as the player's
color, and it will never change color.  This way, a player will always
have some portion of the field that can be used to claim new markers.
</p>

<p>
We say color <var>c</var> applies pressure to some marker <var>m</var>
if <var>m</var> has a color that's different from <var>c</var> and
<var>m</var> is only touching regions of color </var>c</var>.  For
example, if a red marker touches only blue regions, then blue is
applying pressure to the marker.  If color <var>c</var> is applying
pressure to marker <var>m</var> at the ends of 40
consecutive turns, marker <var>m</var> will be coerced to
color <var>c</var> at the end of the
40<sup>th</sup> turn.
</p>

<p>
Pressure on regions and markers is assessed only at the end of each
game turn, after player moves have been received and one turn of
movement has been simulated.  Temporary states that occur during the
simulation of a turn do not interrupt the coercion of markers or
regions.  For example, if a blue marker is completely inside a grey
region, then grey is applying pressure to the marker.  If the marker
touches a red region while a turn is being simulated, but returns to a
grey region by the end of the turn, then the temporary contact with a
red region is not an interruption in the pressure applied by grey.

<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td><img src="crossregion2.png" alt="Blue marker passing quickly
				     through a red region" width=137 height=120/></td>
<tr>
</table>

<p>
Likewise, if a blue region has just one marker touching it and that
marker is grey, then grey is applying pressure to the region.  If that
marker leaves the region, but another grey marker touches the region
before the end of the turn, then grey continues to apply pressure to
the region.
</p>

				    enters" width=179 height=120/></td>
<tr>
</table>

<p>
Color coercion takes place simultaneously for all affected regions and
markers.  It's possible for a region and a marker inside it to be coerced
to each other's colors at the same time.  For example, if a red marker
is inside a grey region that's also touched by a blue marker, then grey
is applying pressure to the red marker, but red is not applying
pressure to the region.  If the blue marker is pushed out of the
region after 20 turns, red will begin applying
pressure to the region while the grey region continues to apply
pressure to the marker.  Another 20 turns later,
the marker may be coerced to grey while the region is coerced to red.

<h2>Gravity</h2>

<p>
At the start of each turn, before players receive descriptions of the
game state, pusher and marker velocities are updated based on
gravitational acceleration and the slope of the region under them.
The location of the center of a pusher or a marker determines what
region it's affected by.  If the center of a game piece is inside a
region that slopes, its velocity will be affected by the slope.  If
the center of a piece is directly on the boundary between two or more
regions, its velocity is not affected by any region (since locations
are represented as real numbers, this condition is unlikely after the
start of the game).
</p>

<p>
The effects of gravity are computed by considering the
three-dimensional geometry of the field.  However, only its influence
in the <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var> directions is used.  The game
does not consider any <var>Z</var> component of velocity for moving
pieces.
</p>

<p>
Gravity is based on a one unit per turn per turn acceleration in the
negative <var>Z</var> direction.  Acceleration due to gravity is
computed by projecting a unit vector in the negative <var>Z</var>
direction, <var>g</var>, into a component perpendicular to the region
surface and a component, <var>p</var>, parallel to the region surface.
The component perpendicular to the surface is ignored.
The <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var> components of <var>p</var> are added
to the velocity of the affected marker or pusher at the start of each
turn.
</p>

<img src="gravity.png" alt="Illustration of gravity calculation" align="center"
     width=250 height=261/>

<p>
The default game visualization indicates how field regions are sloped
by shading the regions appropriately and drawing a little white line
at the middle of the region.  The line represents a vector
perpendicular to the surface of the region.  The thin end points the
way playing pieces will slide while they are on the region.  The
length of the line indicates how steep the slope is.
</p>

<h2>Friction</h2>

<p>
Only the markers are subject to friction.  At the start of each turn,
after the influence of gravity has been considered, friction is
applied.  The speed of each marker is reduced by 0.35
units per turn (or set to zero if speed is less than
0.35).  Since friction is applied after gravity, but
before the turn is simulated, small amounts of gravitational
acceleration may have no effect on a stationary marker.  However a
stationary marker will start to slide downhill if the slope is
sufficiently steep.  Pushers, which do not experience friction, will
always tend to slide downhill.
</p>

<h2>Simulated Time and Collisions</h2>

<p>
During the simulation of a turn, moving objects may collide with each
other or with the edges of the field.  Collisions are handled
elastically and occur on a continuous timescale.  Although players
only see instantaneous snapshots of the game state at the beginnings
of the turns, events like collisions may occur at intermediate times
between these snapshots.  For example, pretend a pusher has a position
three units from the edge of the field and is moving straight toward
the edge with a speed of six.  That pusher will bounce off the edge
one third of the way through the simulation of the turn (pushers have
a radius of 1).  Its velocity will be reversed and its
position will be five units from that edge the next time the player
gets to make a move, provided nothing else interferes with it.
</p>

<h1>Score and Winning</h1>

<p>
A player's score is the size of the player's <i>territory</i>, the
total area of all regions that match the player's color.  This area
calculation considers the size of each region in the <var>X</var>
and <var>Y</var> dimensions, ignoring changes in <var>Z</var> and
effectively projecting regions into the <var>XY</var> plane before
computing their area.  Regions on the map will always have integer
areas.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the game, the player with the largest territory is the
winner.  If there is a tie in the territory size, then players'
territory sizes at the end of each turn are summed across all game
turns.  The player with the larger sum is considered the winner.
